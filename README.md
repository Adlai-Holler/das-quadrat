Foursquare API wrapper in Swift for iOS and OSX

Work in progress!

What has been done:
1. Authorization UI for iOS and OSX.
2. Native oauth on iOS.
3. Access token storing in Keychain.
4. `multi` endpoint.
5. `users` endpoints.


To do:
1. Make variables for all API parameters.
2. Cover all endpoints.
3. Make documentation and how-to.
4. Demo projects.
5. Tests. Yep, it's not TDD :)
6. Podspec.
